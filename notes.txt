Need to review documentation rules and improve documentations in code.

May want to create classes for different company types to create differing paths of data searching.

Insert a check in relevant function to validate that stock cik provides link to interactive tables.

Create a web page that takes the interactive link and creates user options to toggle between R tables
and dates for specific R tables.  Possibly expand on this for dynamic user data storage in db.

Once proof of concept is at a self sufficient point, develop classes for tables to reduce reliance
on dictionary collections.
