In development.

This is a personal project that is currently at the
stage of proof of concept. The final goal is to
develop it as a web app.

Premise: I have noticed that some high yield dividend
investments dilute shareholder value by selling
new shares on the market.  This could be to stimulate
legitimate growth, however I have seen it used to
'balance the books' when the investment isn't profitable.

Solution: To collect investment data from the SEC and
potentially other sources to create an accumulated
multi year view of the company to better discern what
is happening.
